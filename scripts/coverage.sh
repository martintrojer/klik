# Test Coverage Summary

Generated: $(date)

## Overall Metrics
- **Coverage**: ${COVERAGE}%
- **Lines Covered**: ${COVERED}/${COVERABLE}
- **Total Tests**: 66 tests

## Module Breakdown
| Module | Coverage | Lines | Status |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| util.rs | 100% | 18/18 | ✅ Excellent |
| lang/mod.rs | 100% | 19/19 | ✅ Excellent |
| ui.rs | 97.4% | 76/78 | ✅ Excellent |
| thok.rs | 91.4% | 85/93 | ✅ Good |
| main.rs | 22.9% | 30/131 | ⚠️ Needs Attention |

## Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: 66 tests across 5 modules
- **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive boundary testing
- **Error Paths**: Good coverage of error conditions
- **Integration**: Module interaction testing

## Key Strengths
- 100% coverage of critical mathematical functions
- Comprehensive testing of language processing
- Thorough UI component testing
- Strong core typing logic coverage

## Improvement Opportunities
1. Main application infrastructure testing
2. Terminal/TUI initialization coverage
3. Event loop edge case testing
4. File I/O error path coverage

## Quality Assessment
The ${COVERAGE}% coverage represents high-quality, focused testing with excellent
coverage of business-critical code paths. The lower coverage in main.rs is
expected due to terminal/UI infrastructure code that's harder to unit test.
