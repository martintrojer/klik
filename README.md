## Quick Start

### Installation

```sh
# Via Cargo
cargo install klik
```

### Basic Usage

```sh

## Usage Examples

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|

- **Results screen**: `s` for character statistics, `r` to retry, `n` for new test, `t` to tweet

## Intelligent Features

### Adaptive Word Selection
- Analyzes your character-level miss rate and timing
- Scores words based on difficulty of their constituent characters
- Prioritizes practice words containing your most problematic letters
- Balances difficulty to avoid repetitive content

### Character Analytics
- **Real-time tracking**: Miss rate and average time per character
- **Session deltas**: Compare current session performance vs historical data
- **Visual indicators**: Color-coded performance levels (green/yellow/red)
- **Historical trends**: SQLite database stores detailed performance metrics

### Flexible Practice Modes
- **Substitution mode** (`--substitute`): Strategic character replacement in real words
- **Realistic practice** (`--capitalize`): Capitalization, punctuation, and commas
- **Symbol training** (`--symbols`): Brackets, operators, and special characters
- **Strict mode** (`--strict`): Must correct errors before proceeding
- **Custom prompts** (`-p`): Practice with your own text

All flags work independently and can be combined for customized practice sessions.

## Supported Languages
